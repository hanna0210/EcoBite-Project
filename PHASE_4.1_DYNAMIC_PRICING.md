- ‚úÖ **Configurable Rules**: Flexible rule system for different pricing scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive tracking and reporting
- ‚úÖ **Admin Interface**: Easy management of pricing rules

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Service Integration

The dynamic pricing system is seamlessly integrated into existing controllers:

```php
// RegularOrderController
$dynamicPricingResult = $this->applyDynamicPricingToDeliveryFee(
    $vendorId, $baseDeliveryFee, $distanceFee, $latitude, $longitude, 'delivery'
);

// PackageOrderController  
$dynamicPricingResult = $this->applyDynamicPricingToPackageDelivery(
    $vendorId, $basePrice, $distancePrice, $sizePrice, $latitude, $longitude
);
```

### API Response Format

When dynamic pricing is applied, the API response includes:

```json
{
    "delivery_fee": 15.50,
    "original_delivery_fee": 12.00,
    "dynamic_pricing": {
        "is_dynamic": true,
        "demand_level": 2,
        "demand_description": "High Demand",
